## Event Data Notes
* Successful 3 pointers are fg (1) but say '3PT' in them
* Dunks are fg (1), but say 'Dunk' in them
* Both offensive and defensive rebounds are coded 5. Only way to determine which one is by looking at the diff on '(Off: #, Def:#)' which corresponds to that player at that point in the game. This will be a pain...
* Quarter is stored under the 'PERIOD' key in each event.
* The person who is fouled (6) is listed under player 2
