## TODO
* Successful 3 pointers are fg (1) but say '3PT' in them -> Make 3PT event type
* Dunks are fg (1), but say 'Dunk' in them -> Make Dunk event type
* Both offensive and defensive rebounds are coded 5. Only way to determine which one is by looking at the diff on '(Off: #, Def:#)' which corresponds to that player at that point in the game. -> Make different event types for both types of rebounds
* The person who is fouled (6) is listed under player 2 -> Different types of fouls?
